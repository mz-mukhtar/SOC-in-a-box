## 📖 Project Overview

This repository documents the construction of a **Virtual SOC (Security Operations Center)**.

Instead of a simple "flat" network, this project builds a realistic **Gateway Architecture**. It forces all internal traffic through a custom Linux Router (Gateway), where a Suricata IDS (Intrusion Detection System) inspects packets before they reach the internet or other internal servers.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
*   **Network Engineering:** Configuring Linux routing, IP forwarding, and NAT tables manually.
*   **Traffic Visibility:** Implementing a "Chokepoint" architecture to monitor 100% of network traffic.
*   **Threat Detection:** deploying Suricata to detect Nmap scans, malware beacons, and anomalies.
*   **Data Visualization:** Using EveBox to transform raw JSON logs into a modern SOC dashboard.

## 🏗️ Network Topology

The system uses **VirtualBox Internal Networking** to isolate the "Victim" and "Attacker" machines from the host, forcing them to communicate solely through the Gateway.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Quick Summary)

*For the full step-by-step implementation guide, please refer to the [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/mz-mukhtar/SOC-in-a-box/blob/main/setup%20file.md) in this repository.*

### 1. The Gateway Setup
The Gateway is the brain of the operation. It must route traffic between the isolated LAN and the Internet.
```bash
# Enable IP Forwarding (Routing)
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Configure NAT (Allow internal VMs to access internet)
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

### 2. The IDS Configuration (Suricata)
We configure Suricata to listen specifically on the internal interface (`eth1`) to capture traffic *before* it gets NAT'd.
```bash
# Point Suricata to the Internal Interface
sudo suricata -i eth1 -D
```

### 3. The Dashboard (EveBox)
We use EveBox to read the `eve.json` file generated by Suricata.
```bash
# Start the Web Server
sudo evebox server --input /var/log/suricata/eve.json --no-auth
```
*Access via browser at: `http://localhost:5636`*
